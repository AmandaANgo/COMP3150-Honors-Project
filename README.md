# COMP3150-Honors-Project

The student will develop in C or C++ a functional To-Do List application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application will utilize a graphical user interface (GUI) library to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience.

# Compilation Instructions

I used a GUI library called FLTK, so our first step is to install FLTK. Please download and install FLTK from fltk.org following the installation instructions for your operating system.

Once installed, download this GitHub and navigate to where this project directory will be. In the terminal, navigate to the build directory using 'cd build'. Generate the Build System Using CMake: 'cmake ..'. Then compile the project using 'make'. After that, you should be able to run the application using './ToDoList'.
